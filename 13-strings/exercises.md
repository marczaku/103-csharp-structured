# Exercises 13 - Strings

For all of these exercises, for an extra boost of learning, think about, how you could implement these exercises as functions that you can later reuse.

## Basic String Operations

### P13_1_1Length

Write a program that asks the user to enter a string and then displays its length.

### P13_1_2Initials
Create a program that takes a user's full name as (a single) input and then displays their initials in uppercase.

### P13_1_3ReverseWord
Develop a program that reverses a given string entered by the user.

### P13_1_4Vowels
Write a program that counts the number of vowels in a user-entered string.

### P13_1_5WordCount
Create a program that takes a sentence as input and displays the number of words in it.

## String Manipulation

### P13_2_1Replace
Write a program that replaces all occurrences of a specific word in a given string with another word. Prompt the user for both the original string and the words to replace.

### P13_2_2NoSpace
Develop a program that removes all spaces from a user-entered sentence and displays the modified sentence.

### P13_2_3AllUpper
Create a program that takes a string input and capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string.

### P13_2_4ReverseSentence
Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence and then displays it in reverse word order. For example, "Hello World" should become "World Hello."

### P13_2_5Palindrome
Develop a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
