### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P8Math` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- Ask the user for two numbers
- Convert each of them to `double`
- Assign the values to two variables named `first` and `second`
- Print the results of all the mathematical functions, which are shown on the slides, to the user one by one. 
  - For the ones requiring two parameters, pass both variables. 
  - For the ones requiring one parameter, use only the `first` variable. 
  - For the ones requiring three parameters, pass `0` as the second parameter.
