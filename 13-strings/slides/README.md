# Slides 13 - Strings

- Thereâ€˜s a series of functions for working with strings.
- The most commonly used ones are shown in the code sample above. 
You already know, how to define and assign strings
```cs
string firstName = "John";
string lastName = "Kane";
```

## Information
We can get the length of a string returned
```cs
string length = firstName.Length; // 4
```

You can also get the index of the first occurrence of a character or string. Again, counting starts at `0`
```cs
int index = firstName.IndexOf("h"); // 2
```

## Manipulation

We can make a string All-Uppercase or All-Lowercase
```cs
string upper = firstName.ToUpper(); // JOHN
string lower = firstName.ToLower(); // john
```

You can get a sub-part of a string starting at a certain index (1) until the end of the string
```cs
string sub = firstName.SubString(1); // "ohn"
```

You can get a sub-part of a string starting at a certain index (1) with a certain length (2)
```cs
string sub = firstName.SubString(1, 2); // "oh"
```

You can replace all occurances of a character or string with another one
```cs
string replace = fullName.Replace( 'n', 'd'); // "Johd Kade"
```

## Concatenation

We can combine strings into a larger string using the `+`-Operator
```cs
string fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // John Kane
```

We can combine strings using String-Interpolation. Put the `$`-operator before a string and variables between `{` and `}`
```cs
string interp = $"{firstName} {lastName}"; // John Kane
```

## Characters
You can get the character at any index of the string. The first index is `0`
```cs
char char1 = firstName[0]; // 'J'
```

## Immutable

One thing to keep in mind:\
Strings are `immutable`\
That means: A `string` can never be changed.\
So, when you call a function on a variable, it never changes the variable itself.\
Instead, it returns a new string that you can or need to assign to the same, or a new variable.
In other words:
```cs
string fullName = "John Kane";
fullName.Replace('n', 'd');
Console.WriteLine(fullName);
```

```
Output:John Kane
```

```cs
string fullName = "John Kane";
fullName = fullName.Replace('n', 'd');
Console.WriteLine(fullName);
```

```
Output:Johd Kade
```
