### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P02Functions` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- You are only allowed to print:
  - `"Move Forward."`
  - `"Turn Right."`
- Using those two prints, make a character:
  - run three steps forward.
  - then turn around and run three steps forward
  - then turn left and run three steps forward.
  - then turn left and walk one step forward.
  - then turn around and walk one step forward.
- Make sure to introduce functions in order to avoid repetitive code!

## P02_1Hello
Write a C# program that defines a parameter-less void function to print a simple `"Hello, World!"` message. Call this function from the main program.

## P02_2Menu
Create a program that uses a parameter-less void function to display a menu of options to the user. Implement a loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.

## P02_3Random
Develop a C# program that contains a parameter-less void function to generate and print a random number between 1 and 100. Call this function multiple times to display different random numbers.
