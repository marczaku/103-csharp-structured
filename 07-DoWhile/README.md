## Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P7DoWhileLoops` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- Create a Function named `AskNumberBetween`
  - It has two number parameters: `min` and `max`
  - It returns a number.
  - It asks the user as many times as necessary to give a number between `min` and `max`
  - It returns the result, when it is valid.
- Use above method two times and print the result (the returned value) each time to the console:
  - Once for a number between `1` and `3`
  - Once for a number between `41` and `103`
