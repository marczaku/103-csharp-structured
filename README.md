## Goal

This course will introduce you to writing reusable code using functions, using Loops in order to replace to `goto` Keyword and using `Array` for storing and using many values of the same kind.

## Passing Criteria
- Completed The Real Nim Game
- Use Functions!

## Excellent Criteria
- Completed either:
  - The Real Nim Game using an Array
  - Tic-Tac-Toe using a 2D-Array

# 0 First Steps
- [ ] Start the Assignment through Learnpoint.

# 1-5 Functions
## Goal
Learn about scopes and functions. See, how we can use functions to pack code into reusable and parameterized blocks.
- Scopes
- Functions
- Call Stack
- Return & Output
- Parameters & Input

# 6-10 Loops
## Goal
Here, we will learn about using Loop-Keywords to structure our Program in repeatable iterations. This way, we can replace the use of the `goto`-Keyword with more standardized functions. Increasing our code's readability.
- While
- Do..While
- For
- Break
- Continue

# 11-12 Arrays
## Goal
Loops allow us to repeat the same instructions 100 times or even a million times. But how can we store 100 or even a million variables? The answer is: using Arrays. We'll learn about what Arrays are and how to use them to store and read information from them.

# 13 Strings
## Goal
Learn methods for working with strings.

# 14 Game On
## Goal
Let's make another game!
